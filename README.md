# PintOS: Building Operating Systems

Welcome to my PintOS project repository! 
## Overview

PintOS is an educational operating system framework designed to help students understand the fundamentals of operating system development. It includes various components and features commonly found in real-world operating systems, such as process management, memory management, and file systems.

This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for the PintOS project, showcasing the successful implementation of key operating system concepts.

## Features

- **Process Management:** Implementation of user-level threads, process scheduling, and synchronization mechanisms.
- **Memory Management:** Virtual memory management with demand paging and frame allocation.
- **File Systems:** A simple filesystem (PintosFS) supporting file operations like create, remove, read, and write.
- **I/O Devices:** Support for I/O devices, including console input/output and keyboard input.
- **Shell:** A basic shell for interacting with the operating system.
